# Radio Tanda (`radiotanda`)

## All good things must come to an end ...

### After three years of Radio Tanda, the tango world is returning to its pre-pandemic vibrancy ... and with that, Radio Tanda will be playing its last tanda on March 22, 2023. Thank you for your support over these years!

## About

### Site files for the Radio Tanda tango streaming station at [radiotanda.com](http://www.radiotanda.com).

Just a simple HTML/CSS single-page site for directing visitors to the Live365 stream of [Radio Tanda](http://www.radiotanda.com) (and, of course, the [donation link](https://ko-fi.com/radiotanda)!). 

While I might have *really really really wanted* to spin up my own streaming station, things get tricky with international royalties, and in the interest of getting the music to the dancing folks more expediently, using a third-party service (as of now, Live365) currently makes the most sense. It still needs a pretty entry point, though, with links to the schedule and stream. Hence this simple little site.

## A sad but important note

Why no tandas on a service called, ironically, Radio Tanda? Unfortunately, American DMCA rules really keep this from being possible. To quote:

> A Webcaster must comply with the “sound recording performance complement,” which prohibits a Webcaster from transmitting, within any given three hour period:
> (A) more than three different songs from the same album, with no more than two such songs transmitted consecutively.
> (B) more than four different songs by the same artist or compilation, with no more than three such songs transmitted consecutively.

Sadly, that's *kind of how tandas work*. So, for the sake of experimentation, the streaming station alternates between a mixture of traditional and alternative tango, largely chosen at random but adjusted as possible for aesthetic niceness. Note that in order to satisfy DMCA rules, you may also hear an alternative song in the traditional programming here and there.

If you happen to be listening to Radio Tanda and hear something that you find to just be horrible, please [open an issue](https://github.com/jessicaschilling/radiotanda/issues/new?assignees=jessicaschilling&labels=&template=song-problem.md&title=Incorrect%2Fawful+song%3A+%28song+title+here%29) for it.

## Contribute!
If you're a tango-lovin' developer and you'd like to help make this project better, please let me know! I'd love to collaborate. :heart:

Or, if you're able to [help offset the costs of the streaming service](https://ko-fi.com/radiotanda), that would be amazing, too. Rights and streaming costs can get crazy expensive, and I'm relying on the tango community to help keep this thing operating!
