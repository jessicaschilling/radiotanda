# Radio Tanda (`radiotanda`)
### Site files for the Radio Tanda tango streaming station at [radiotanda.com](http://www.radiotanda.com).

Just a simple HTML/CSS single-page site for directing visitors to the Live365 stream of [Radio Tanda](http://www.radiotanda.com) (and, of course, the [donation link](https://ko-fi.com/radiotanda)!). Now that quarantine life is keeping me from DJing at festivals and milongas, I want to do whatever I can to make sure we can all enjoy a tanda wherever we may be.

While I might have *really really really wanted* to spin up my own streaming station, things get tricky with international royalties, and in the interest of getting the tandas to the dancing folks more expediently, using a third-party service (as of now, Live365) currently makes the most sense. It still needs a pretty entry point, though, with links to the schedule and stream. Hence this simple little site.

If you're a tango-lovin' developer and you'd like to help make this project better, please let me know! I'd love to collaborate.
