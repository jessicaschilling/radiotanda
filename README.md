# Radio Tanda (`radiotanda`)
### Site files for the Radio Tanda tango streaming station at [radiotanda.com](http://www.radiotanda.com).

Just a simple HTML/CSS single-page site for directing visitors to the Live365 stream of [Radio Tanda](http://www.radiotanda.com) (and, of course, the [donation link](https://ko-fi.com/radiotanda)!). Now that quarantine life is keeping me from DJing at festivals and milongas, I want to do whatever I can to make sure we can all enjoy a tanda wherever we may be.

While I might have *really really really wanted* to spin up my own streaming station, things get tricky with international royalties, and in the interest of getting the music to the dancing folks more expediently, using a third-party service (as of now, Live365) currently makes the most sense. It still needs a pretty entry point, though, with links to the schedule and stream. Hence this simple little site.

### A sad but important note

Why no tandas on a service called, ironically, Radio Tanda? Unfortunately, American DMCA rules really keep this from being possible. To quote:

``
A Webcaster must comply with the “sound recording performance complement,” which prohibits a Webcaster from transmitting, within any given three hour period: (A) more than three different songs from the same album, with no more than two such songs transmitted consecutively. (B) more than four different songs by the same artist or compilation, with no more than three such songs transmitted consecutively.
``

Sadly, that's *kind of how tandas work*. So, for the sake of experimentation, the streaming station alternates between a mixture of traditional and alternative tango, largely chosen at random.
