# Radio Tanda (`radiotanda`)

## All good things must come to an end ...

### After three years of Radio Tanda, the tango world is returning to its pre-pandemic vibrancy ... and with that, Radio Tanda will be playing its last tanda on March 22, 2023. Thank you for your support over these years!

## About

### Site files for the (erstwhile) Radio Tanda tango streaming station at [radiotanda.com](http://www.radiotanda.com).

Just a simple HTML/CSS single-page site that was used for directing visitors to the Live365 stream of [Radio Tanda](http://www.radiotanda.com). Now that the station is no more, this repo really only exists for archival purposes.

While I might have *really really really wanted* to spin up my own streaming station, things get tricky with international royalties, and in the interest of getting the music to the dancing folks more expediently, using a third-party service (Live365) made the most sense. It still needed a pretty entry point, though, with links to the schedule and stream. Hence this simple little site.

## A sad but important note

Why no tandas on a service called, ironically, Radio Tanda? Unfortunately, American DMCA rules really keep this from being possible. To quote:

> A Webcaster must comply with the “sound recording performance complement,” which prohibits a Webcaster from transmitting, within any given three hour period:
> (A) more than three different songs from the same album, with no more than two such songs transmitted consecutively.
> (B) more than four different songs by the same artist or compilation, with no more than three such songs transmitted consecutively.

Sadly, that's *kind of how tandas work*. So, for the sake of experimentation, the streaming station alternated between a mixture of traditional and alternative tango, largely chosen at random but adjusted as possible for aesthetic niceness. Note that in order to satisfy DMCA rules, listeners also heard an alternative song in the traditional programming here and there.

Although there's no real point any longer, if you feel the need, please [open an issue](https://github.com/jessicaschilling/radiotanda/issues/new?assignees=jessicaschilling&labels=&template=song-problem.md&title=Incorrect%2Fawful+song%3A+%28song+title+here%29).

Radio Tanda benefited — read, was paid for — by the generous donations of members of the global tango community during the three years of its life. Thank you to everyone who listened, everyone who enjoyed, and especially everyone who contributed!
